Kia ora! Thanks for dropping by.

I'm Caleb Tutty, and this is my personal blog. I work for [Westpac
NZ](https://www.westpac.co.nz) as a Data Scientist (although all views
are my own).

I previously worked as a Data Journalist in the [Insights
team](http://insights.nzherald.co.nz) at the [New Zealand
Herald](http://nzherald.co.nz). I built the Herald Insights sub-site and
worked on stories like KiwiSaver investments in cluster munitions and
landmines, political donations, electoral results, the gender pay gap
and housing affordability. I have a keen interest in data visualisation
on the web as story telling.

Prior to journalism I worked as a full stack developer, for a few
different [cool and interesting
companies](http://carnival.io).

Feel free to [LinkedIn stalk

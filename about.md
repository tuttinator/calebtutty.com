Kia ora! Thanks for dropping by.

I'm Caleb Tutty, and this is my personal blog. I work for [Westpac
NZ](https://www.westpac.co.nz) as a Data Scientist (although all views
are my own).

I previously worked as a Data Journalist in the [Insights
team](http://insights.nzherald.co.nz) at the [New Zealand
Herald](http://nzherald.co.nz). I built the Herald Insights sub-site and
worked on stories like KiwiSaver investments in cluster munitions and
landmines, political donations, electoral results, the gender pay gap
and housing affordability.

I help [FYI](https://fyi.org.nz) with servers and things (and made it that lovely shade of green), but [eey0re](https://twitter.com/eey0re) is the real hero who does most of the work.

I have a keen interest in web-based data visualisation as
story telling and want to share some tricks of the trade. Hopefully
some of my blog posts will be useful for budding data journalists,
civic technologists and anyone else intersecting the Venn diagram of my
unabashedly geeky interests.

Prior to journalism I worked as a full stack developer, for a few
different [cool and interesting
companies](http://carnival.io).

Feel free to [LinkedIn stalk

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Caleb_T), [Github](https://github.com/tuttinator), or drop me an email: contact _AT_
